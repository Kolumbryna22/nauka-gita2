    <h2>Stairway to heaven</h2>
    <p>Led Zeppelin</p>
    <p>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold 
        And she's buying a stairway to heaven. 
        When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed 
        With a word she can get what she came for. </p>
    <p>There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure 
        'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings. 
        In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings, 
        Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.</p>
